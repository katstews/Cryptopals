# Cryptopals

Set 1 was ok, but set 1 challenge 6 was incredibly confusing. I guess easy to implement, but wrapping my mind on the concept is just holy cow. Learned great concepts from this, mainly **frequency anaylsis**. It's easy to just brute force and find the key if its just a small amount of text. But what happens if the text is 1000+ characters and you have to XOR it agaisnt every printable character? That's where frequency analysis come to help and it makes it so much easier to find where the key as the scoring will tell you what the plaintext is.
